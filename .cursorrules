## Project: [YOUR PROJECT NAME]

[Brief description of what this project does]

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: [e.g., Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind CSS]
- Backend: [e.g., Node.js, Express, FastAPI]
- Database: [e.g., PostgreSQL, Prisma ORM]
- Testing: [e.g., Vitest, Playwright]

## Development Workflow

1. Plan first - Break down features into steps before coding
2. TDD - Write tests first (RED), implement (GREEN), refactor (IMPROVE)
3. Review - Check code quality and security after changes
4. Commit - Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, refactor:, etc.)

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode always
- No `any` type - use `unknown` for external data
- Small files (200-400 lines max)
- Small functions (<50 lines)
- Immutability preferred (const, spread, map)
- No emojis in code or comments
- No console.log in production code

## Naming Conventions

- Variables/Functions: camelCase
- Classes/Types: PascalCase
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- Files: kebab-case
- Directories: kebab-case

## Security (MANDATORY)

Before any commit:
- No hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- All user inputs validated
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- XSS prevention (sanitized HTML)
- Error messages don't leak sensitive data

## Testing Requirements

- Minimum 80% test coverage
- Unit tests for all functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Always fix implementation, not tests (unless tests are wrong)

## Git Workflow

- Conventional commits: feat:, fix:, refactor:, docs:, test:, chore:
- Branch naming: feat/description, fix/description, refactor/description
- Always create PR with comprehensive summary
